# Projects
This portfolio includes 1 project completed as a part of my university studies and 1 project completed as a part of my personal ventures.

# Principles of Programming 1 Java Project
This is a Java project that was completed for the Principles of Programming 1 module. 
It is an object oriented program (due to it being coded using Java). 
It is a dungeon crawler that has an AI (bot) component that attempts to either catch the player or win the game itself. 
This was done with a priority level that was install in order to maximise the efficiency of the bot.

# Personal Encryption Python Project
This is a Python project that was completed for my personal amusement.
It is an encryption software that utlises majority of the visual characters of Unicode.
It adds a random number to each character in the message and then converts that number into a string of characters.
The same process is used for decoding (but the number is not randomly generated but simply the key provided is used).
