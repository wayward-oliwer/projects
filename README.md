# Projects
This portfolio includes 2 projects completed as a part of my personal ventures.

# Personal Encryption Python Project
This is a Python project that was completed for my personal amusement.
It is an encryption software that utlises majority of the visual characters of Unicode.
It adds a random number to each character in the message and then converts that number into a string of characters.
The same process is used for decoding (but the number is not randomly generated but simply the key provided is used).

# Personal Chess Python Project
This is a Python project that is still being worked on for my own pleasure.
It is a Chess program that allows 2 players to play a game of Chess together.
It has a set of rules made for each piece and the board is stored as an object.
This is all done to maximise the efficiency of checking the validity of the moves as well as searching for a checkmate.
